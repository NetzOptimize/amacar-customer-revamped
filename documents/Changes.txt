Hi Neeraj
I am going over the website,
Found few things,

I came up with some Phase 1 and Phase 2 contents to make sure the page is visible for the viewers.

Please view this google Doc

On this section, 
 
OPTION 1: Two Tabs (Best for UX)
Tab 1: Selling Your Car (Live Auction)
 Tab 2: Buying a Car (Reverse Bidding)
When user clicks the tab, the 5-step flow updates.


OPTION 2: Side-by-Side Columns
 Left column = Sell
 Right column = Buy
Both have 5 step


Dev notes:-  Proceeded according to the document.

I want to dedicate amacar.ai only for customers, so I decided to remove the Dealer reviews from here and only keep Customer reviews.
Could you please remove them and add them to Dealerportal.amacar.ai?

Also the dates on the reviews are all the same dates, Let's put different dates one or 2 weeks apart.

Later on, I will get some dealership in LA to give us their reviews so we can add them to Dealerportal.amacar.ai as a reference to persuade other dealers to join us.

----------------------------------------------------
I need to landing page here so that I can link it to facebook ads because I want customers to click on "Get Quote" and the link take them straight to Appraisal page instead of the complete page.

------------------------------------------------------
Here I see (New & CPO).

I need it to be (Used & CPO) Because CPO Stands for "Certified Pre-owned) so it stands with Used Category.
Make it like this.
New
Used & CPO

--------------------------------------------------------------------

the pricing needs to be Bold and easy to ready.
The sample is on the right side of the pages.

I need them to be like $8,750, $17,000, $17,500
Also used cars don't have MSRP, Instead they have "Listing Price" Let's change that. 

And also, New cars have MSRP, Let's make sure MSRP is visible there for the viewers. 

Question: could you check if you can fix the pictures on the new cars? I don't see Pictures and MSRP Price. 

Try again, and let me know , I will send an email to Cox Automotive to fix the issue and let us know. 


I took these screenshot, as reference, Let make sure we apply the same rule across the website on all the New and Used cars. in generate. that is the Industry Standard and easy for customers to navigate through. 





Certificate has too much information and it has compliance issues. 
Here is the refine one, nothing more, nothing less. 
This certificate reflects the competitive offer submitted by the selected dealership during the reverse-bidding process and represents the vehicle’s sales price only. Taxes, government fees, dealer documentation fees, and optional add-ons are not included and may apply at the dealership. Amacar.ai only facilitates the competitive bidding process and does not set, control, or guarantee final pricing or “out-the-door” totals.

Note: If you are purchasing with cash, financing, or leasing, this amount will serve as your sales price, subject to vehicle availability at the time of purchase.

Keep:
Vehicle info
Accepted price
Dealer name/city/Point of Contact
Online Certificate 
Date
Amacar Logo
Hi Neeraj 

Very important Note: The Speed on the website, photos and information is so low and it take time for the pictures to load. This is affect our online presence and leads and customer conversion. 

How can you fix this to make sure the speed is high first. 

Then let's focus on the stuff I mentioned about.
